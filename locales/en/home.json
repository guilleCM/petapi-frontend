  "aboutDescription": "Adopting a dog from the kennels of Mallorca is a real odyssey. The entries of these pets in the animal protection centers are very scarce and the demand is very high. The current situation forces you to be aware of the different kennels and when they are uploading new entries to their websites. So if you get distracted or can't always keep an eye on the kennels' websites, it's likely that when you find a dog you like, you'll already be ahead of them in the booking process.",
